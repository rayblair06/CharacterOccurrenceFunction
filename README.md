## Synopsis

Small Application that collects a piece of text into an array, counts the total words, then all the unique words, iterates through multiplying by the repeats to show the total character occurrence.

## Motivation

I created this script as part of a Skills Test I was given by a company, if you feel anything can be added or done better then feel free to contact me or show me your ideas. Additionally I may change the textarea to asynchronously load the text and count rather than loading in a .txt file but I originally constructed my ideas towards writing the function than aesthetics.

## Installation

Change the path within App.php to any .txt file, or change the task1.txt file directly. Tests can be found in the "tests" folder.
