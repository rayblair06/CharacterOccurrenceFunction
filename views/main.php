Experience the ‘living cloud’ here at RSPB Saltholme

As winter approaches in the Tees Valley, dark clouds begin to form overhead – but these are clouds to be marvelled at, as thousands of starlings flock together to put on a spectacular display – and we're inviting you to experience it first-hand.

Join us for our annual ‘Soup and Starlings’ evenings throughout November and December to witness this fantastic wildlife show.

Our friendly and knowledgeable staff will show you the best place to see the birds and a delicious mug of hot soup will be on offer to keep you warm whilst you sit back and enjoy the show.

While you might have seen the spectacular starling murmurations on wildlife programmes on TV, nothing beats seeing them in person. Wrapping up and going to see a starling murmuration is well worth the effort and no words can describe the sight and sound of so many birds moving together.

For most of the year, these small, chattering birds perch on aerials and descend en masse on bird feeders, but in the autumn and winter months, UK starlings are joined by large numbers of European birds who come to escape the harsher continental winters, and form huge flocks - or 'murmurations' to give them their proper name.

Murmurations take place at roosting sites, and the reed beds at RSPB Saltholme provide the perfect overnight roost for starlings. The birds arrive in small groups, slowly at first, and build up to a swirling, pulsing group that shifts with a fluid motion, a cloud of birds moving as one, before dropping into the roost, just as darkness falls.

Grouping together in such huge numbers is thought to be important for exchanging information, for example where the best feeding grounds are, as well as providing warmth and safety in numbers.

Our Soup and Starlings evenings are the perfect way to see this amazing, awe-inspiring sight.

The Soup and Starling evenings will run on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday evenings  throughout November and December from 3-5pm – as long as the starlings remain with us!

Booking for these events are essential so, to reserve your place, call our visitor centre on 01642 546625.
